iterimg - library for D. Designed for processing images in range format.

It contains the implementation of working with color, an interface for image iteration, iteration functions,
viewing (saving pixels to memory/file) of images and basic image processing functions such as Gaussian blur,
image rotation, image cropping and image merging.

Run the following:

dub run :simpletest -- image.png 

This is for performance testing. There should be an image.png image in the folder where you launch from.
